# PyBer_Analysis
PyBer Analysis with Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.

# Overview of the analysis:

Pyber is a python based ride-sharing app company. We performed Exploratory data analysis from the CSV files. We created several types of visualization story from data to present complex finding in a way that is informative and engaging to all stakeholders. We used Pandas, SciPy, Numpy to perform various calculations and statistics analysis that would help us to demonstrate the relevance of the data such as:
1.    Number of rides for each city
2.    Which city types are generating the most money
3.    which types of cities need more driver support.

V. Isualize has given us a brand-new assignment. Using our Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, we created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, we submited a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
