# PyBer_Analysis
PyBer Analysis with Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.

# Overview of the analysis:

Pyber is a python based ride-sharing app company. We performed Exploratory data analysis from the CSV files. We created several types of visualization story from data to present complex finding in a way that is informative and engaging to all stakeholders. We used Pandas, SciPy, Numpy to perform various calculations and statistics analysis that would help us to demonstrate the relevance of the data such as:
1.    Number of rides for each city
2.    Which city types are generating the most money
3.    which types of cities need more driver support.

V. Isualize has given us a brand-new assignment. Using our Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, we created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, we submited a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
# Results:

We used Python skills, Pandas libraries , and mattplotlib  in jupyter note book to create a variety of outputs such as:

•    The total rides for each city type:
Rural        125
Suburban     625
Urban       1625

•    The total drivers for each city type:
Rural         78
Suburban     490
Urban       2405

•     The total amount of fares for each city type:
Rural        4327.93
Suburban    19356.33
Urban       39854.38

•    The average fare per ride for each city type:
Rural       34.623440
Suburban    30.970128
Urban       24.525772

•    The average fare per driver for each city type.
Rural       55.486282
Suburban    39.502714
Urban       16.571468

## PyBer summary DataFrame is created.
